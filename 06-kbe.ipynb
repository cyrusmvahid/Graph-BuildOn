    "# Introduction to Knowledge Graph Embedding\n",
    "There has been a huge focus, both in academia and industry, on Graph Neural Networks in the past 3 years. A surge of GNN papers, toolkits, and knowledge graph embedding tools is ensued as a result of interest. We, at AWS, have created an open source library for creating, training, and performing several GNN inference tasks, called Deep Graph Library or DGL. DGL is a high performance and highly distributed Graph Neural Network library. On the top of DGL, we have released a knowledge graph embedding tool called DGL-KE, which outperforms similar products thanks to numerous innovations in distributed KGE training for link prediction task. \n",
    "To be able efficiently and effectively apply DGL-KE to KGE tasks, it is however important to understand what the models in the core of DGL-KE do and where they perform best. This blog details out KGE models that are implemented in DGL-KE and is a fundamental to understanding of DGL-KE's functional capabilities."

    "Knowledge Graphs are often modeled as directed multigraphs. As a quick reminder let us define multi-graph and directed graphs:\n",
    "•\tIn a directed graph edges are called arcs and they can direct information from their tail to their head nodes but not in the opposite direction.\n",
    "•\tA multigraph is a graph that can include loops as well as multiple relationships between the same nodes. for more information on Graphs you can check this \n",

    "Knowledge graphs that are beyond toy examples are always large, high dimensional, and sparse. High dimensionality and sparsity are the results of the amount of information that the KG holds that can be represented with 1-hot or n-hot vectors. The fact that most of the items have no relationship with one another is another major contributor to sparsity of KG representations. We, therefore, desire to project the sparse and high dimensional graph representation vector space onto a lower dimensional dense space. This process is similar to to word embedding and dimensionality reduction used for [recommender systems baesd on matrix factorization models.](https://www.slideshare.net/apachemxnet/building-content-recommendation-systems-using-mxnet-gluon)\n",

A fact in the source space is represented as a triplet $(h, r, t)$ where $h$ is short for *head*, $r$ is for *relation*, and $t$ is for *tail*. The relationship is interpreted as a translation vector so that the embedded entities are connected by relation $r$ have a short distance. [3, 4]\n",

TransR addresses this issue with separating relationship space from entity space where $h, t \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ and $r \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. The semantic spaces do not need to be of the same dimension. In the multi-relationship modeling we learn a projection matrix $M\\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times d}$ for each relationship that can project an entity to different relationship semantic spaces. Each of these spaces capture a different aspect of an entity that is related to a distinct relationship. In this case a head node $h$ and a tail node $t$ in relation to relationship $r$ is projected into the relationship space using the learned projection matrix $M_r$ as $h_r=hM_r$ and $t_r=tM_r$ respectively.Figure 5 illustrates this projection.\n",

As TransR projects entities to a relationship space of dimension $k$, it will require $O(kd)$ parameters per relation. depending on the size of k, this could potentially increase the number of parameters drastically. In exploring DGL-KE, we will examine benefits of DGL-KE in making computation of knowledge embedding significantly more efficient.\n",

RESCAL is expressive but has an exponential complexity, while DistMulti has linear complexity but is limited to symmetric relations.\n",

It is using a rank-decomposition based on a diagonal matrix. We know that dot product of embedding scale well and handles symmetry, reflexity, and irreflexivity effectively. Matrix factorization methods have been very successful in recommender systems based on some variation of MF. MF works based on factorizing a relation matrix to dot product of lower dimensional matrices $\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{V}^\\top$ where $\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times K}$. The underlying assumption here is that the same entity would be taken to be different depending on whether it appears as a subject or an object in a relationship. For instance \"Quebec\" in \"Quebec is located in Canada\" and \"Joe is from Quebec\" appears as subject and object respectively. In many link prediction tasks the same entity can assume both roles as we perform graph embedding through adjacency matrix computation. Dealing with antisymmetric relationships, consequently, has resulted in an explosion of parameters and increased complexity and memory requirements.\n",

Each complex number has two parts, a real and an imaginary part and is represented as $c = a + bi \\in \\mathbb{C}$. As expected, the complex plane has a horizontal and a vertical axis. Real numbers are placed on the horizontal axis and the vertical axis represents the imaginary part of a number.

This asymmetry is resulted from the fact that dot product of complex matrices involves conjugate transpose.\n",

    "We are not done yet. Do you remember in RESCAL the number of parameters was $O(d^2)$ and DistMulti reduce that to a linear relation of $O(d)$ by limiting matrix $M_r$ to be diagonal?. Here even with complex eigenvectors $E \\in \\mathcal{C}^{n \\times n}$, inversion of $E$ in $X=EWE^{*}$ explodes the number of parameters. As a result we need to find a solutions in which W is a diagonal matrix, and $E = E^*$, and $X$ is asymmetric, so that we 1) computation is minimized, 2) there is no need to compute inverse of $E$, and 3) antisymmetric relations can be captures.\n",
