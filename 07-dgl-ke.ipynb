    "# Introduction\n",
    "In a [previous post](Intro2KBE.html), I describes the KGE models that are implemented as a part of DGL-KE. This blog provides  details about optimizations that are implemented by DGL-KE that makes it very efficient for multi-device and distributed training as well as providing an example that can be run on a laptop.

    "# What is DGL-KE\n",
    "DGL-KE is a high performance, easy-to-use, and scalable package for learning large-scale knowledge graph embeddings. DGL-KE contains a python package atop DGL in order to be able to take advantage of distributed graph operations implemented by DGL. DGL in turn takes advantage of popular deep learning libraries such as MXNet and Pytorch for performing tensor operations.\n",

    "As illustrated in the picture above, DGL-KE implements some of the most popular knowledge embedding models such as TransE, TransR, RotateE, DistMulti, RESCAL, and ComplEx. More details about the models cab be found [here](http:./blogs/Intro2KBE.html). \n",
    "The models are implemented in python and rely on pytorch in order to run. The runtime includes DGL Graph for graph operations, DGL Sampler to perform sampling and triplets sampling, and a key-value pair in memory data store,DGL KVStore, specifically designed for DGL-KE to hold embedding in distributed training. The KV store has graph partitioning capabilities it uses to distribute graphs across multiple machines."

Relation embeddings, however, are loaded onto GPU memory in order to reduce data transfer. GPU processes, read the data from the shared memory and update the gradients on the CPU shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster training is little bit different as we need to split the data and maximize locality per machine, so a kv-store server will be deployed across the training network and KG, structure, relation, and entity embeddings will be stored on the kv-store. kv-store automatically partitions the embedding, using a min-cut based graph partitioning method. The trainer prfocess, then uses *push* and *pull* API in order to fetch the data and send the gradients back. A short description of randomized min-cut is in the appendix A of this blog for those who want to know more about it.\n",
