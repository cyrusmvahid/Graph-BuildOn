    "# Graph Neural Networks, an introduction, part 2: A gentle introduction to graph theory.\n",
    "in the [previous post](01-motivation.md), we learn why we need to pay attention to GNNs. Before we can actually learn about GNNs, we need to learn some of the basics of graph theory to be able to understand parameters of the GNN methods as well as technical aspects of the papers. If you are familiar with graph thery, please skip to [next part](03-mpnn.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first of a 5-part series to gently introduce the reader to Graph Neural Networks. Part 1 intends to provide the basic terminology of graph theory as well as an brief introduction of networkx, a popular graph computation library, to the readers that are new to graphs. The next 4 parts describe 1) intuition behind GNN, 2) Message Passing Neural Network or MPNN framework, which is the foundation of out Deep Graph Library DGL, our implementation of GNN, 3) A basic understanding of DGL, and finally 4) and tutorial as how to use DGL for most common use cases.

Up until recently we  had not observed any planet outside of the solar systems, simply because planets do not emit enough light to be observable by telescopes. according to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, Objects with mass feel an attractive force that is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance, or $$F=G\\frac{Mm}{r^2}.$$\n",

    "So, if a star affects orbit of a planet that revolves around the star, the planet also does affect orbit of its star slightly. Add to that that there are potentially several planets in a solar system, , then planetary gravity does influences orbits of planets and starts in solar system. Those little wobbles, resulted by smaller mass of planets, was used to discover the first exoplanets. This is in short a multi-body system. In a simplified model of a solar system, the orbits of the planets and the stars are dependent mass of the objects and distance to the star. HEre we are ignoring the effects that the planets have on one another and assume that there is only one start in the system. This can be modeled using a graph data structure.
